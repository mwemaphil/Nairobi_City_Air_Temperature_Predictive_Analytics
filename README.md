# Predicting the City of Nairobi Air Temperature using Scikit Learn
![Nairobi](https://github.com/mwemaphil/Nairobi_City_Air_Temperature_Predictive_Analytics/assets/45120853/62b0284b-7888-4e2a-a43a-ee97810af6d3)

This is an analysis of the Air Temperature levels of the City of Nairobi as read from various sensors situated across the city. The data has been acquired from [AfricaOpenData](https://africaopendata.org/dataset/sensorsafrica-airquality-archive-nairobi). The values from the datasets include sensored data of different types, i.e Particulate Matter denoted as P0, P1 and P2, Humidity and Temperature. For this exercise we will concentrate of temperature values to create a predictive model to be able to predict the temperature around the City of Nairobi.
Model prediction using LinearRegression utilized sensor data of temperature from the previous 6 months to create predictive trained models and utilized OOctober data which is the current month as of creating of this notebook, to test the trained models.



        This analysis and predictive model was built by  Philip Mwema.
        Tools Used --> Python - pandas, numpy, pytz, matplotlib, scikit-learn libraries
